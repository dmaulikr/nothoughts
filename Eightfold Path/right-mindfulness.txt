Right Mindfulness is to understand that nothing is permanent. 
~You stop clinging to your suffering, because you realize it is not an absolute and permanent state. You stop clinging to your happiness, and so you enjoy it more fully when it comes.
~When you learn to let go to things you cling to needlessly you are able to be more present.
~It takes practice and strength of will, but if you exercise your mindfulness, it will improve, like any skill.
