Right Speech is speaking with Right Thinking.
~You shouldn’t speak with the intent of bringing about anger, jealousy or sadness, only understanding.
~You should only claim something to be true when you know it to be true, not when you only have evidence that it might be true, because evidence can often exist in many directions.
~You shouldn’t exaggerate or embellish.
~While speaking seems like an outward act, you must be mindful of the inward effects of wrong speech versus right speech.
~Right Speech encompasses all of communication. In order to practice Right Speech you have to listen as well.
