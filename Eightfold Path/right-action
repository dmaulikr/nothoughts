Right Action is to commit yourself to act accordingly to cultivate compassion to yourself and to others.

You begin Right Action by treating your own body with compassion. If you know that physical exercise today will make you more present tomorrow, do not instead do something that you know will make you less present.

As you learn to act compassionately to yourself, you will learn to act compassionately towards others.
