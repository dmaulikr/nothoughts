Right Livelihood is to earn your living in a way that doesnâ€™t cause you or others to suffer. 

This can be achieved by questioning whether your everyday work is in accordance with love and compassion.

However, Right Livelihood also means to examine whether your own habits outside of work support businesses and professions that do cause harm to others.
