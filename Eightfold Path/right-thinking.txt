Right Thinking is to see that everything is a process.~
Instead of wanting to achieve anything and everything all at once, you recognize that there are steps and that there is time.~
You are open to the idea that you might be suffering needlessly from unidentified false perceptions. When you identify them, you can let them go.~
You can also identify habits that cause us to suffer, in order to break free of them. It is important you do not judge yourself when you fail to stop habits right away. It is a process.~
Right Thinking is the practice of cultivating understanding in ourselves and to see the world as it truly is, in order to bring about happiness in others.
