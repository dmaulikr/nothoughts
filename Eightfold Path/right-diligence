Right Diligence is the balance between hard work and joy. If you are practicing a skill every day, such as meditation or a sport, and it is bringing you closer to joy, this is Right Diligence.

On the other hand, if you are practicing excessive hours, and this practice is causing you long term suffering, and pushing you away from loved ones, this is not Right Diligence.

Right Diligence means accepting your current psychological and physical limits. It is okay to push yourself, but donâ€™t break yourself. It is also okay to rest.
