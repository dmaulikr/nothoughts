Right Concentration is to understand that attention is a constant and universal trait. In other words, you are always paying attention to something.
~With this understanding, you can learn to be aware of your attention at any moment, and then shift it to your breathing, or your body, or what you are currently doing, and bring your attention to the the present moment.
~Do not use your concentration to runaway from suffering, but to be more present no matter what your mental state might be.
